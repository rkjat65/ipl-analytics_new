## Release outputs

- Google Play Android App Bundle: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- Optional Android APK for direct testing: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
- App Store IPA: `build/ios/ipa/crickrida.ipa`

The Android private upload keystore and its passwords are intentionally excluded from Git. Back up `android/upload-keystore.jks` and `android/key.properties` together in a password manager or encrypted vault. Losing the upload key complicates future updates.

## Final console checklist

- Enrol in Apple Developer Program and Google Play Console, accept current agreements, and complete banking/tax details if requested.
- Create the app records using the exact package identifiers above.
- Upload the AAB to a Play internal-testing track and the IPA through Transporter/Xcode, then resolve any console-only validation warnings.
- Upload the store copy, icon, feature graphic, and screenshots in this directory.
- Complete App Privacy, Data safety, content rating, target audience, ads, and government-app declarations using the verified privacy table above.
- Add the privacy and account-deletion URLs, then confirm both are publicly reachable without signing in.
- Configure the production `SMTP_*` environment variables so password-reset links can be delivered; never enable `EXPOSE_RESET_TOKEN` in production.
- Provide App Review with a test account only if account creation is unavailable during review; otherwise use the review note above.
- Confirm the legal contact, copyright name, privacy answers, AI-provider disclosure, and rights to any cricket statistics or media before pressing Submit.
